*Last Days of Koreshan* is a historical drama short film based on a true story, exploring how utopian idealism can crumble when unfulfilled promises are made by false prophets.

**It's 1908: Cyrus Teed, aka Koresh, leader of the egalitarian, socialist, and celibate Koreshan Unity, has uttered his last breath.** Fortunately for him and his followers, salvation is upon them when his soul is transferred into the body of his platonic co-leader, Victoria Gratia. Unfortunately for the Koreshans, his teachings haven't made clear when that will be. As they wait for Victoria's arrival, Teed's sister and most devoted follower, Emma, must lead the community in prayer while his body lies on display in a bathtub—testing time, her faith, and notions of mortality.

Although it occurred over a century ago, the tale of the Koreshans is one both overlooked and quite prescient towards today's climate.
