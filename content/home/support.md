Based on a true story, *Last Days of Koreshan* explores how utopian idealism can crumble when unfulfilled promises are made by false prophets. Although it occurred over a century ago, the tale of the Koreshans is one both overlooked and quite prescient towards today's climate.

We're raising funds for art department needs, special effects, and crew meals to bring this story to life. Your contribution — big or small — helps make this film a reality.
