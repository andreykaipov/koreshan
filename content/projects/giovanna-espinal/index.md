Originally from Miami, Giovanna is a production designer drawn to visual storytelling through character and space. Her work focuses on world-building, with an emphasis on creating environments that feel lived-in and emotionally grounded.

With a foundation in costume design, she brings a thoughtful sensitivity to texture, detail, and character, approaching each project collaboratively and with respect for the story being told.
