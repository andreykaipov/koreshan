Adrienne Seraphina Helene Tabet is a figure sculptor responsible for works held in galleries and museums such as Mana Contemporary, 621 Gallery, 1310 Gallery, Tallahassee Museum of Fine Arts, and Thomas Dean Fine Art, Art Basel, and in major works of film such as NCIS New Orleans and Roots (2016). With a large material range and profound connection to nature, she explores any and all things required to bring forth the vision harmoniously, including metal, wood, clay, resin, stone, wax, recycled material, bone, animal skin, and plants.

Adrienne is a queer, mixed-race Lebanese American, raised between the layered realities of Miami and the Middle East. Intertwined within her lifetime as a sculptor, she is also a Bodyworker, Energy Worker, and Death Doula, utilizing Sculpture as a large-scale healing modality — a Bridge between worlds.
