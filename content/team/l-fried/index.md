**L. Fried is the director, writer and producer of *Last Days of Koreshan*.** It all began in the year 2020, when the world was wrought with COVID. Fearing a state shutdown, L returned to South Florida to be closer to her family during uncertain times. They began taking weekend trips around Old Florida, to explore pockets they hadn’t seen before. L’s sister, Adina, recommended the Koreshan State Park—about a 2 hour drive from their hometown; this is when L first learned about the eccentric society.

There are many components of the Koreshan’s story that fascinates L. The impetus for this short film began with the image of Teed’s body on display in a zinc tub, and the unshakable faith his followers held, refusing to bury him and believing he would return, just as Jesus had. While Teed is no doubt a compelling figure, upon doing more research, L’s curiosity centered around his sister and interim second-in-command, Emma, and what was going through her mind during such uncertainty. 

Having come from a background in Design and Art History, L is also intrigued by belief systems and cultural moments that ultimately shape society and the objects we surround ourselves with. 

While in the Pacific Northwest, she worked for institutions such as the Seattle Art Museum, Northwest Film Forum, The Stranger and CUT. Her debut short film, *I Know How You Like Your Coffee* was an official selection at Local Sightings Film Festival, Tacoma International Film Festival, and Twist. Since then, and after spending over a decade in Seattle, L has returned to the swamps from whence she came.  

In the last year, L has partnered with the Hollywood Historical Society, designing *100 Years Young: Our Founder’s Vision*, an exhibition for the Centennial of Hollywood, Florida's creation. She has also worked on Florida-based short films including *Madame* (set dresser), *Underground River* (set dresser), *The Steele Brothers Band* (set dresser), and *Wing Man* (editor). Last Days of Koreshan is L’s directorial debut since returning to her home state.
