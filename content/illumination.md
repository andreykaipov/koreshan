*You have found what was hidden.*

---

In the autumn of 1869, in a small laboratory in Utica, New York, Dr. Cyrus Reed Teed conducted an experiment that would change his life, and the lives of hundreds who would follow him into the hollow of the Earth.

The details of that night have been told many ways. Some say he was knocked unconscious by an electrical shock; others, that he fell into a state of deep meditation. What is not disputed is what he claimed to have seen: a woman, luminous and terrible, who appeared to him and spoke seven truths.

**Six of those truths became the foundation of Koreshanity:**

1. *God is both male and female, a biune deity.*
2. *The universe is a cell, and we live on its inner surface.*
3. *Immortality is attainable through celibacy and devotion.*
4. *The sun is at the center of the hollow Earth, not beyond it.*
5. *Reincarnation is the natural process of spiritual evolution.*
6. *A New Jerusalem must be built to prepare for the coming age.*

<div class="revelation">
The seventh truth was never published in any Koreshan text.<br>
It is this: <em>The prophet must die so that the people may live.</em>
</div>

Teed knew. From the moment of his illumination, he understood that his death would be the final proof, not of failure, but of completion. The followers who waited beside his bathtub on Estero Island in December 1908 were not fools. They were witnesses to a man who had spent forty years preparing them for the very moment they could not accept.

When the Lee County health officer ordered the burial on December 27th, Sister Anastasia sealed a testament of faith inside the wall of the stone mausoleum: *"We the disciples of Koresh, Shepherd, Stone of Israel, know that this sepulcher cannot hold his body."*

The hurricane of 1921 washed the mausoleum into the Gulf of Mexico. Only the headstone remained: **"Cyrus, Shepherd, Stone of Israel."**

His body was never recovered.

The last official Koreshan, Hedwig Michel, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany who found purpose in the ruins of another's prophecy, died in 1982. She is the only Koreshan buried within the park that now stands where the New Jerusalem was meant to rise.

**You found this page.** That means you've been paying attention.

These hidden messages, ciphers, and whispers are part of *Last Days of Koreshan*, a historical drama short film about the Koreshan Unity's final hours. The film is set on December 22, 1908, the day Cyrus Teed died, and follows his followers as they place his body in a bathtub and wait for the resurrection that was promised.

It's a story about what happens when faith meets mortality, and what it costs to believe in something, or someone, completely.

If you've made it here, we'd love to hear from you. You're the kind of person this film was made for.
