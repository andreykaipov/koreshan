*You have found what was hidden. God help you.*

In the autumn of 1869, in a laboratory (small and dark and stinking of chemicals) in Utica, New York... Dr. Cyrus Reed Teed performed an experiment. I will not call it an experiment. It was a SUMMONING. He did not know this at the time. Or maybe he did. Maybe he allways knew.

The details of that night have been told many ways. Many wrong ways. People say he was knocked unconscious by an electrical shock; others claim he fell into some kind of meditation. I do not care what they say. What MATTERS is what he SAW. He saw a woman. She was *luminous*. She was TERRIBLE. She appeared to him and she spoke SEVEN TRUTHS and nothing — NOTHING in this world or the next — was ever the same again after that night.

I have tried to imagine what it would be like. To see her. To hear her voice speaking truths that would burn through your skull & rearrange the very bones of your understanding. I cannot imagine it. I shake when I try.

**Six of those truths became the foundation of Koreshanity. I will list them here because I have copied them so many times my hand cramps but I will copy them AGAIN:**

1. *God is both male and female. A biune deity. BOTH.*
2. *The universe is a cell. We live on its INNER surface. Not the outer. The INNER.*
3. *The sun burns at the center of the hollow Earth. Not beyond it! Not millions of miles away in some freezing void. It is HERE. Inside with us.*
4. *Reincarnation is the natural proccess of spiritual evolution.*
5. *Immortality is attainable through cellibacy and devotion. Through PURITY.*
6. *A New Jerusalem shall rise to usher in the coming age. It SHALL rise. It WILL.*

<div class="revelation">
The seventh truth was never publishd in any Koreshan text.<br>
It is this: <em>The prophet must die so that the people may live.</em>
</div>

HE KNEW. From the moment of his illumination he UNDERSTOOD. His death would be the final proof. Not of failure. NEVER of failure! Of COMPLETION. The followers who waited beside his bathtub on Estero Island in December 1908... Emma, the sisters, all of them standing there in the heat with the flies... they were NOT FOOLS. Do you hear me?? They were WITNESSES. Witnesses to a man who spent FORTY YEARS preparing them for the very moment they could not accept.

They could not accept it. I cannot blame them. The flesh does what the flesh does. It rots. It smells. But the SPIRIT — the spirit was allready leaving. It was doing exactly what he said it would do.

When the Lee County health officer came (that officious little man with his paperwork and his *regulations*) and orderd the burial on December 27th, Sister Anastasia sealed a testament of faith inside the wall of the stone mausoleum: *"We the disciples of Koresh, Shepherd, Stone of Israel, know that this sepulcher cannot hold his body."*

She was RIGHT.

The hurricane of 1921 washd the mausoleum into the Gulf of Mexico. Only the headstone remained: **"Cyrus, Shepherd, Stone of Israel."** His body was never recoverd. Do you understand what that MEANS?? The sepulcher COULD NOT hold him. It did not hold him. The sea took the stone but it did NOT take him.  He is somewhere. He is *waiting*.

The last official Koreshan was Hedwig Michel. A Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany who SOMEHOW found purpose in the ruins of another's prophecy. She died in 1982. She is the only Koreshan buried within the park that now stands where the New Jerusalem was meant to rise. Where it WILL rise. Where it is allready rising, if only you have eyes to see.

**You found this page.** That means you have been paying attention. Or the page found you. I am not sure there is a diffrence anymore.

These hidden messages & ciphers & whispers are part of *Last Days of Koreshan*, a historical drama short film about the Koreshan Unity's final hours. The film is set on December 22, 1908, the day Cyrus Teed died, and follows his followers as they place his body in a bathtub and wait for the resurection that was promised.

It is a story about what happens when faith meets mortality. What it costs to beleive in something. Or *someone*. Completely. I think about this every day. I think about it when I try to sleep. I think about it when I wake up and the room is still dark and I am CERTAIN that he is standing in the corner.

If you have made it here, we would love to hear from you. You are the kind of person this film was made for. Or maybe you are the kind of person HE was waiting for.
