Been teasing this for a while. But pieces are moving, and Last Days of Koreshan is underway! Many moving pieces, but first let me introduce you to the story:

It's 1908: Cyrus Teed, aka Koresh, leader of the egalitarian, socialist, and celibate commune Koreshan Unity, has uttered his last breath. Fortunately for him and his followers, salvation is upon them when his soul is transferred into the body of his platonic co-leader Victoria Gratia. Unfortunately for the Koreshans, his teachings haven't made clear when that will be. As they wait for Victoria's arrival, Teed's sister and most devoted follower, Emma must lead the community in prayer while his body lies on display in a bathtub—testing time, her faith, and notions of mortality.
