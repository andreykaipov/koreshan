Its official: in two weeks Last Days of Koreshan will be launching a Seed&Spark campaign to raise $7,700 for the art department for Last Days of Koreshan!

If you're interested in contributing, filling out this brief survey (link & QR on second page) will allow me to send you a reminder before we go live, 24 & 48 hours prior. Pledging within the first 24 hours really helps the trajectory of the film's fundraising.

If you want to save time on the launch day, you can also create a Seed&Spark account now and follow my profile for updates.
