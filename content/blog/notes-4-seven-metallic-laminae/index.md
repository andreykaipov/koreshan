I had my friends over for a housewarming last weekend. They asked what I was using my spare room for, so I showed them how I use it to draw and meditate. They looked through one of the notebooks and got really curious! But then they just stopped abruptly and we went back downstairs. I dont get it because I even had nice insence burning in the room. But it's colder downstairs so I get it.

The notebook I handed them had the seven metallic layers. Five mineral strata. The geologic formations we walk on. Gold at the outermost rind, the final boundary, the incorruptible skin of everything. I've drawn it so many times now I can do it with my eyes closed. When I travel for work It's fun to doodle on the the hotel notebooks they leave in your room. NIce and compact. One of the evenings I was a bit exhausted from a team dinner so I went to a ramen bar by myself. Was doodling there too instead of having my attention stolen by the blue light of a phone. The waitress there asked if I was an engineer and sure while technically true I said no, I'm just a student. And she said of what.

Of everything. Of the inside of everything.

I felt like I was in a movie.

Koresh wrote that the shell is about a hundred miles thick. That that between the metallic layers is a continuous spiral canal through which mercurial substance flows, and that this canal corresponds to the alimentary canal of the human body. Not as a metaphor. Structurally. The universe is built like a body because the man is the archetype of the cosmos and the cosmos is the archetype of the man. When you understand this you start to feel your own heartbeat as the electromagnetic pulse of the shell and the blood in your veins as the mercurial flow between the laminæ and then you cannot unfeel it.

I was feeling really good one morning (who knew going to bed on time works) so I was up and about quite early taking a walk and caught my neighbor. Yup that [same neighbor who likes to golf](/news/we-live-inside/), and I tried to explain the mercurial disci to him. How the planets aren't worlds in a void but amalgamated spheres between the metallic strata, pushed along by solar radiation. But I stopped halfway through. I learned to read body language. I'm not an idiot. He smiled politely the way you smile at someone you want for to stop talking.

Well guess what? What goes around comes around.

Nobody wants to hear about your dog's vet appointment either.
