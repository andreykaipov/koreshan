description: The railroad tracks appear to converge. They do not converge.
---
For those of you who don't know, I live in Miami, well not technically, it's an hour north of actually Miami, but you'd have no clue what I mean if I didn't call it Miami. There's a big railroad that runs all the way from South Miami to Jackonsville. The [East Coast Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_East_Coast_Railway) (thank goodness for clear naming conventions). If you're going past I95 from US1, you'll hit the railroad and if you don't slow down the car will take a bump. But nobody cares. Everybody drives so wreckleslly. There's been a few instances where these same people leave their car on the tracks during the red light because they don't listen to the LOUD ASS BELLS and don't stop BEHIND the pole bar that's coming down. You can guess what happens next.

Imagine what it feels from the train conductor's perspective. The rails are roughly five feet apart, but when they look down the line, they converge into a point because our eyes can't see infinitely far enough in front of us. So they appear to meet at a point in the distance. This is our retina compensating and essentially guessing how the eventual image should look. It's how those AI upscaling algorithms work. The technical term is perspective foreshortening. The image of a distant space contracts on the back of the eye proportionally to the distance.

Now let me take you, dear reader, on another tangent. I went on a date to this park near me and there was this big wooden tower we climbed up. It was about sunset so I thought it was a really romantic idea. When we stood there, and we looked at the horizon, I couldn't help think to myself that the surface was curving downward. And it made me smile, and she asked what I was smiling at. And I wondered how to explain it to her.

I pointed out how the horizon looks like it's curving downward. You can't argue that. I was literally looking at it with my own eyes. And that's the problem. Even before Keplar who *improved upon* Copernicus's theories (albeit not fully), since the 15th century or whenever, any average laymen pointed at this appearance as evidence of the Earth's convex nature. But there's a missing secret sauce. It's literally the same illusion as the trains crashing into Florida drivers. The same foreshortening. The same guessing because human eyes will never be perfect. Even if the earth were flat, it would look convex. Even if it weren't concave, it would still look convex. It's akin to us living in a non-Euclidean space, but still being able to do Euclidean geometry, if we so choose to limit our math to those axioms. The convex appearance proves nothing because you're trying to play chess with the rules of Tic Tac Toe.

The whole of Copernican astronomy is built on an optical artifact and not one of them has ever submitted it to mechanical verification. To give y'all an actual metaphor... If we could choose different axioms (i.e. our eyeballs), it would look different. But we can't, because the nature of evolution has given us the eyeballs we have and we should be practice gratitude for that. Squid eyeballs for example are superior for seeing in deep, low-contrast, almost pitch-black water, but that doesn't mean light doesn't exist at all. Light exists above the surface, but squids just have no need for it. From the context of a squid, of course the light doesn't exist. It's the same thing.

> *However perfect our theory may appear in our estimation, and however satisfactorily the Newtonian hypothesis may seem to account for all celestial phenomena, yet we are compelled to admit the astounding truth, that if our premises be disputed and our facts challenged, the whole range of astronomy does not contain the proofs of its own accuracy.*<br>
> *\- Professor Woodhouse of Cambridge*

Their own man. An eminent astronomer at Cambridge, saying in print that the entire discipline stands on authority. Not measurement. Authority. The say-so of men who inherited an assumption and never checked it. Because you can't.

I read this quote six months ago online and it made me so angry I literally got up and went to go for a walk. Walking through the park after work, all these people running by, every one of them believes the Earth is convex because a teacher told them so, and that teacher believed it because another teacher told THEM so, and so it goes back and back and back and back to Copernicus, who guessed, and nobody since then has ever laid a piece of tinted mahogany against the water and looked at where the line goes. Well, now it's time to bring sexy back.

Koresh looked. He called the astronomers "mountebanks". The Lord himself said "fools and blind". Koresh quoted it because, he wrote, "it was the best way to exasperate people and set them thinking".

I've always been a thinker. And I sincerely mean that in the least pompous way possible. If you don't want to think about it, that's fine, it's not my job to convince you.

Sound familiar? The squids can't touch light, but I'll touch it for them.
