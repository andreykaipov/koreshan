description: "Late night, seven metals in my mouth."

I keep going to bed late man. Whenever I start to taste metal att he back of my throat I know it's probably way past my bed time. I know they say blood tastes like metal because of the iron content, but it's definitely not blood. It's like copper or gold or at least one of the seven.

Koresh wrote that we're approaching a [great biologic conflagration](/news/the-cellular-cosmogony/). Thousands will dematerialize through electromagnetic vibration directed by one mind.

He didn't write this as some kind of speculation. He wrote it the way you write a schedule in your notebook (which I should really do actually). It's already fixed, already set, already underway before the ink dries.

People hear "dematerialize" and think woowoo poetry metaphor. It is NOT metaphor.

Matter becomes spirit-substance. Spirit-substance is still substance. The body doesn't die. It converts. The consciousness does not end, it infolds. Like an envelope that bends. This is what happened to [him in 1908](/news/the-death-of-cyrus-teed/). The bathtub. The sisters. The _waiting_. The flies. They were watching a process they had no framework to recognize. But if they had the framework... well... whose to say? No point in fixating on the past is what they all say/

The air in my room on the second floor gets very hot because I don't like running the AC too much. They say the hot air rises, so it has nowhere to go. But I lie there before I fall asleep and think... it's happening. The vibration is building somewhere between the three atmospheres and the stellar nucleus. The transmutation is still ongoing. It didn't just stop when they carried the body out.

I am terrified when I let that thought sink in. But it's not fear. It's terrific. Look it up. It's a positive word.
