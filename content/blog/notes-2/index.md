<p class="arg-hero-whisper">The curve goes up. It has always gone up. You are standing on the inside of the egg.</p>

I went to Naples. I went to the beach (tell em bring out the whole ocean). I stood where *the Rectilineator* stood.

Something on my ankles. Not ants in my pants. A pulling. I know how that sounds. _Why doesn't someone pull me...?_ If you focus, and I mean really focus by clearing your mind before hand and getting a good night's sleep, you can feel the ground was curving toward something instead of away from it. If you know you know. It's like that primal intuitive sensation (the amygdala, had to google that admittedly) from before we rotted our brains from endless sex at our fingertips. But you can feel it curve toward your body.

In 1897, Prof. U.G. Morrow supervised the geodetic survey. The Koreshans placed perpendicular standards at the edge of quiet water. Horizontal bars of that sweet well-seasoned [mahogany and brass](/news/the-cellular-cosmogony/), adjusted to precision. They extended a chord from the top of the uprights at right angles to two points at the surface of the water.

And guess what we all already now it. The line met the water.

It went down to the water. Curve upward. Earth concave. Measurements? Eight inches to the mile. I'm so stiff.

I love hearing that number. I say it to myself when I'm frying eggs in the morning. In the shower. I tell my Hinge dates about it. They don't't get it. When I walk outside and I catch my neighbor, I start talking about it so I can get out of the stupid conversation they want to talk about. "Oh I'm going golfing at the gun range on the weekend." Brother good for you, how about you go read a fucking book? Nobody understands eight inches to the mile means? It means the surface we stand on bends toward the sky. It means there ain't no fucking sky. There's a center sure we can allll agree on that. But the sun is at the center, not ninety-three million fucking miles away in some vacuum that doesn't exist. It's right there though, only FOUR thousnad miles above your head, turning at a very comfy speed on its HELICAL axis.

So I stood on that beach for like an hour. And these tourists. I can't blame them. You gotta love Florida since there's not state income tax unlike California. I saw seagulls swoop down. I looked into the Gulf of Mexico and it looked back at me (I fee llike I read that before somehwere?) that's did not ignore me. I fyou squint you see it. Uit curving upward in every direction and I was standing at the bottom of the bowl for the cat food we call life, ececpt God was dropping me the kibble down the incline of the inside of the sphere the univeseee. THAT ONLY HAPPENS IF WE"RE ON THE INSIDE OF THE SPHERE, NOT OUT.

I'll go back soon.
