Before there was Florida Man, there was a society with peculiar beliefs seeking refuge in the hostile swamps of South Florida. "Last Days" is a film made in and about that community and why it didn't pan out exactly as their leader had prophesied.

Based on a true story, this short explores how utopian idealism can crumble when unfulfilled promises are made by false prophets. Although it occurred over a century ago, the tale of the Koreshans is one both overlooked and quite prescient towards today's climate.
