<p class="arg-hero-whisper">The shell holds everything. The shell IS everything. Read until you understand or until your eyes can read no more.</p>

The book is alive!

And I don't mean that as one of those woohoo poetry flunkies. I mean that every time I open the Cellular Cosmogony, the sentences rearrange themselves into configurations that weren't there the last time I read it. As in, there's still something new I learn every time. 

Koresh composed it from his articles in *The Flaming Sword*, publishd by the Guiding Star out of Estero. The place where [he would die](/news/the-death-of-cyrus-teed/) and be [laid to rest](/news/cyrus-teed-laid-to-rest/) in a bathtub while the sisters prayed and the flies circled. The capital of the world.

The premise fit in two sentences:

_The earth is a concave sphere with a diameter of eight thousand miles. We live on the inside._

That's it.

Everything else: the [three atmospheres](/news/we-live-inside/), the [seven metallic laminæ](/news/seven-metallic-laminae/), the helical sun, the mercurial disci, the biologic conflagration, are just corollaries from the basic axioms. Man I miss my set theory and real analysis classes. Mind you I'm more of a pure math guy so I don't wanna just regurgitate everything out of there here, but the most most straightforward experiment goes as follows:

A straight line is extended from perpendicular standards at right angles to the water's surface. That line meets the water. And the curve slopes upward. Eight inches to the mile.

They built The Rectilineator for this and proved it on a Naples beach. In 1897. You can find some schematics and images online but imagine how sweet that bitch woul.d look. Fresh mahoagany. Polished brass. Mahogany and brass. Just like the homes Amy asks us to build, and the necklace underneath the shack east of the village of Barbarians. Ship the two together. Brgany. Mahoass. The ass man.

I keep coming back to the following excerpt. I've rea dit so mahy times the page is crinkly in the corner from holding onto tit.

*"We are now approaching a great biologic conflagration. Thousands of people will dematerialize, through a biologic electro-magnetic vibration. This will be brought about through the direction of one mind, the only one who has a knowledge of the law of this bio-alchemical transmutation."*

I read it and church bells ring. it's like when you strike them and the ringing doesn't stop for minutes. And if you stnad really close you can feel the ringing in your teeth. I mean I don't have cavities and love the dentist, so it doesnt' necesarily hurt me, but I'm just saying you have to be mindful of things like that. BY the way, It's fine if you do that sort of thing. I have friends who go to other kinds of churches and we still get along.

He wrote that in the 1890s. And then boom died in 1908. Ok. And the sisters put him in a bathtub and waited for the transmutation and who came instead was the Lee County health officer with paperwork.

But read it again.. The word he used is *approaching*. Not *imminent*. Approaching!

It's like that MF DOOM line from Ballskin:

*Disappear, reappear, and disappear again.*
