## The Planetary Court

The temporal affairs of the Koreshan Unity were governed not by Cyrus Teed, but by the **Planetary Court**, a council composed exclusively of women, whom Teed called the **Seven Sisters**.

This was by design. In his illumination of 1869, it was a woman who appeared to Teed and revealed the truths of cellular cosmogony. He believed that the divine was *biune*, both male and female, and that women were the natural stewards of spiritual authority.

The Seven Sisters lived together in the Planetary Court building, which still stands today in Koreshan State Park. Henry Silverfriend, the only man permitted to reside there, served as their protector.

Seven sisters. Seven truths.

Virginia recorded six of them in her journal. The seventh, the one Teed said was "not for this age," was entrusted not to paper but to the Court itself, passed from sister to sister in spoken word.

When the last sister died, the seventh truth should have died with her. But Etta Silverfriend, the Treasurer, was meticulous. Buried in the financial ledgers of the Unity, between tallies of mullet sold and lumber sawed, she encoded a message in the only cipher the Unity ever used.

**From the ledger of Etta Silverfriend, 1907:**

<div class="fs-cipher">BPM XZWXPMB UCAB LQM AW BPIB BPM XMWXTM UIG TQDM. BPQA QA BPM AMDMVBP BZCBP. QB QA VWB NWZ BPQA IOM.</div>

<span class="unity-whisper">The same key. The same measure. Eight inches.</span>

If you have come this far, you already hold the key.

The Rectilineator measured the concavity of the Earth at eight inches to the mile. It also measures the distance between a cipher and its meaning.

<p class="pc-final-hint">The sisters kept the truth. The ledger kept the proof. You keep the secret.</p>

<span class="unity-whisper">Decoded: THE PROPHET MUST DIE SO THAT THE PEOPLE MAY LIVE. THIS IS THE SEVENTH TRUTH. IT IS NOT FOR THIS AGE.</span>
