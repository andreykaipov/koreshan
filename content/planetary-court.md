## The Planetary Court

The temporal affairs of the Koreshan Unity were not governed by Cyrus Teed. Let me be CLEAR about this. They were governed by the **Planetary Court**, a council composd exclusively of women. Teed called them the **Seven Sisters** and when he said their name his voice would change. It would drop low and become something else, something that was not entirely his own voice anymore.

This was by DESIGN. In his illumination of 1869 (that terrible night in Utica) it was a WOMAN who appeared to him. Not a man. Not an angel with wings & a trumpet. A *woman*, luminous and awful. She reveald the truths of cellular cosmogony and she did not ask his permission and she did not wait for him to be ready.

He beleived that the divine was *biune*. Both male and female. And that women were the natural stewards of spiritual authority. He was RIGHT. I have seen what the sisters can do when they pray together. I have heard them. It is not a sound you forget. It is not a sound you WANT to forget.

Henry Silverfriend (the only man permited to reside in the Court building) served as their protector. The building STILL STANDS today in Koreshan State Park. You can go there. You can touch the walls. You can put your hand where their hands went and feel... I swear you can FEEL something.

Seven sisters. Seven truths. This is not a coincidence. THERE ARE NO COINCIDENCES.

Virginia recorded six of them in her journal. The seventh — the one Teed said was "not for this age" — was entrusted not to paper but to the Court itself. Passd from sister to sister. Mouth to ear. Breath to breath. *Spoken word only.* Because paper BURNS. Paper rots. But a voice repeated in the dark, sister to sister, year after year? A voice becomes something that cannot be destroyd.

When the last sister died, the seventh truth should have died with her. SHOULD HAVE. But Etta Silverfriend — *the Treasurer*, God bless that meticulous terrifying woman — she found a way. Buried in the financial ledgers of the Unity, between tallies of mullet sold & lumber sawed, she ENCODED a message. She hid the truth in the NUMBERS. In the only cipher the Unity ever used. She knew. She knew the paper might survive even if the voices did not.

**From the ledger of Etta Silverfriend, 1907:**

<div class="fs-cipher">BPM XZWXPMB UCAB LQM AW BPIB BPM XMWXTM UIG TQDM. BPQA QA BPM AMDMVBP BZCBP. QB QA VWB NWZ BPQA IOM.</div>

<span class="unity-whisper">The same key. The same measure. Eight inches.</span>

</div>

If you have come this far then you allready hold the key. You have ALLWAYS held the key. I think maybe you were born holding it.

The Rectilineator measured the concavity of the Earth at eight inches to the mile. It also measures the distance between a cipher and its meaning. Between what is hidden and what is REVEALED. Between death & what comes after.

<p class="pc-final-hint">The sisters kept the truth. The ledger kept the proof. You keep the secret. And when HE RETURNS you will understand why it had to be kept at all.</p>

<span class="unity-whisper">Decoded: THE PROPHET MUST DIE SO THAT THE PEOPLE MAY LIVE. THIS IS THE SEVENTH TRUTH. IT IS NOT FOR THIS AGE.</span>
